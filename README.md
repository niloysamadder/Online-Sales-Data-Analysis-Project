# Online Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building an end-to-end data pipeline and analytical dashboards for an **Online Sales Dataset**. The dataset contains sales data, including orders, products, and customer information. The primary goal is to analyze business performance, identify growth opportunities, and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

The project integrates Azure Data Factory for ETL processes, Azure SQL Database for data modeling, and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

## Business Goals
1. Automating the ETL pipeline to streamline data ingestion and transformation processes.
2. Building a **star schema** for optimized querying and data modeling.
3. Analyzing key metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Profit**, **Order Trends**, and **Product Insights**.
4. Forecasting future business growth to aid strategic planning.
5. Providing intuitive and actionable visualizations for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory**: For ETL pipeline automation.
- **Azure SQL Database**: For data modeling and creating a star schema.
- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualization and dashboards.
- **GitHub**: For project documentation and version control.
- **SQL**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **DAX (Power BI)**: For custom calculations and measures.

## ETL Pipeline Workflow
![ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/niloysamadder/Online-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/8c1af4915a254d2295d4204750bbe9fc67b56b20/ETL%20Pipeline_Online%20Sales%20Data%20Project.PNG)
The ETL pipeline extracts raw data, transforms it (e.g., categorizing products, handling duplicates), and loads it into Azure SQL Database for analysis. The key steps include:
1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data directly from the source systems using https link service.
2. **Data Transformation**: Standardized, cleaned, and enriched the data using Data Flow.
3. **Data Loading**: Populated the star schema in Azure SQL Database.

## Star Schema Data Model
![Star Schema](https://github.com/niloysamadder/Online-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/8c1af4915a254d2295d4204750bbe9fc67b56b20/Database%20Schema_Online%20Sales%20Data%20Project.PNG)

The star schema includes:
- **Fact Table**: `FactSales` containing transactional data.
- **Dimension Tables**: Including `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, `DimDate`, `DimOrderPriority`, and more.

This schema improves query performance and enables seamless integration with Power BI.
